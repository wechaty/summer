### Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

GSoC has attracted many students to join the open-source project like Wechaty, and they may become long-term contributors. Open-source projects always require both of new and old developers, so GSoC is a important program for us to recruiting young developers.

### What would your org consider to be a successful summer?

Most projects could be completed successfully. The students are happy to work on Wechaty and would love to tell their friends. The user community is excited about the results, and at least one newcomer continues to contribute after the GSoC summer.

### How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

20+

### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

We use Gitter, WeChat, and GitHub as our main communication channels with Zoom meetings when needed. In order to monitor the whole process, we will have meeting once a week to discuss GSoC, so that problems can be discovered as early as possible. Each student will have at least two mentors to avoid problems of disappearing mentors. In addition, the GSoC administrator will supervise the entire project.

Many of the mentors have 2+ years of experiences of the Wechaty project, they would love to have new and young contributors to join.

### How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

Our mentors are usually on our Gitter channel (We have connected the Gitter with WeChat) and they can be reached at most of the time, so it will not be hard to schedule communications between mentors and students. Our GSoC administrators (some are also mentors) will track the progress of each project at a higher level. We use GitHub for code management so we can easily monitor progress by Issues and PRs.

In order to be selected, students need to complete an basic task from GitHub. This requires them to build and start looking at the code, which makes students more confident about future tasks, and our mentors also have the opportunity to understand how students work.

All students are required to submit progress reports on the GitHub issues under their projects every week, and to submit/update GitHub Issues/PRs every week. This will help find difficulties before the student is really lost.

### How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

Before students apply for GSoC, they are welcome to join our contributor program. In the contributor program, we encourage students to participate in discussions on Gitter and WeChat, creating their own open-source project for a MVP, or post blogs to share their thoughts about our project.

Our mentors will encourage students to introduce their ideas to the community to get involved. We believe that students need to do more than just write code. They need to interact with the community by proposing solutions and iterating them until they reach a community consensus.

### How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

We are always encourage new contributors to play more with our project because it will be a funny journey for chatbot builders. If a contributor start using Wechaty as their chatbot SDK solution, they will mostly like to find new feature request, and bugs.

Our contributors/committers community have 160+ peoples and it's a great place to sharing ideas, talking about the new features, and bug fixes. All GSoC students will be part of the community, and we will try to help them stay motivated. We believe that an open and active community is one of the best assets to retain contributors.
